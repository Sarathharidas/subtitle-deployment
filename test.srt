00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
Hi guys, I'm Prevna and welcome back.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,800
This is part 2 of the Back to Basics series.

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,800
In case you don't know about this series,

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:13,100
some time ago, I started a brand new series on this channel called Back to Basics.

5
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:18,600
The idea behind this series is to share some simple styling and grooming tips

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:24,400
that anyone can easily inculcate in their routine without having to be a fashionista.

7
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,200
So in part 1, I shared some grooming tips with you.

8
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,700
What am I going to do today?

9
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:34,400
Today, I'm going to share with you how I drape a saree.

10
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:39,400
The irony is that on this channel, I've made a lot of styling videos

11
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:43,800
but I didn't make a single video sharing how I drape the saree.

12
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,300
So this is the video that you all had been asking for.

13
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:52,900
I hope after this video, every girl who seems to be very complicated in her draping

14
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:59,200
will get all this uncomplicated and she embraces the gorgeous saree.

15
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,300
I hope you enjoy this video. Let's get started.

16
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:18,800
Let's talk about the blouse first because I'm going to drape both the sarees with this.

17
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:23,900
The fabric is mesh and the lining inside is a sweetheart neckline style

18
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,200
which I think looks so pretty.

19
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:30,200
The back is cut deep and there are hooks on the collar and side.

20
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,100
Now, if you're wondering where I bought this blouse from,

21
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:39,700
I actually got it stitched 6 years back and wore it to my college convocation ceremony as well.

22
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:42,900
Now for the underskirt, I'm wearing a traditional petticoat.

23
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:48,500
One important tip that I want to share is that petticoat is the base of all the draping

24
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,400
and it will hang on to your saree.

25
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:56,900
So, if this guy is loose, you are in trouble. So, tie the petticoat tight.

26
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:00,700
Don't stop the blood circulation but it should be tight.

27
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:05,300
And as long as the petticoat is tight, your saree will not go anywhere.

28
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,500
Now, let's come to the actual topic.

29
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,800
I'll say it in the YouTube comments. So, this is the point where the video starts.

30
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,800
Okay.

31
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,100
Start with grabbing one end of the saree.

32
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:19,800
This is the non-fancy end which will go inside.

33
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:26,100
You have to place it on the center and start moving from your left.

34
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:30,100
Bring it around once and tuck it to your right.

35
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:37,000
While doing this step, ensure that the length of the saree is as long as it should not touch the floor.

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,900
As in, it should not touch the floor as the saree should not touch the floor.

37
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:48,600
But at the same time, it should be so long that if someone is looking at you from the back,

38
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,100
then only show your heels.

39
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:55,600
This determines how graceful your look is.

40
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:02,400
And this is precisely the reason why everyone suggests that you should wear heels before the saree drips

41
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,800
because you will end up messing the length later.

42
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:12,600
So, once you are done with this step, next you have to grab the fancier end which is the pallu of the saree.

43
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:19,600
And bring it around from your left to the right and place it on your left shoulder.

44
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:24,300
This is the point where you will decide how long the pallu should be.

45
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:30,000
Now, this is again a very critical step as critical as the length of the saree.

46
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,200
So, I like the length of the pallu from the bottom.

47
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,500
It should fall on my calf area.

48
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:42,700
If I tell you precisely, it should be 2 inches longer than the knee, like that is the length I like.

49
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:49,900
And I have personally observed that if the pallu is long, then the all over look looks more graceful.

50
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,000
Also, the height also looks more graceful.

51
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,400
So, this is again very important.

52
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,300
Once you have decided the length of the pallu,

53
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:05,400
after that, you have to grab the top part of the pallu tightly from the back to the left leg.

54
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,800
And you have to tuck it on the left side.

55
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:15,100
Now, at this point, some people put a pin here in the downward slanting motion.

56
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:18,300
And I have seen a lot of people and YouTubers do it.

57
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:21,400
But this trick never worked for me.

58
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,100
So, I will show you what I do.

59
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,100
So, first of all, we will make pleats.

60
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,200
Whose pleats will we make?

61
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:31,100
The pleats of the fabric that you can see in the front.

62
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:36,100
To make pleats, grab the fabric from the right hand like this.

63
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:39,800
Keep the index finger in front of you, keep the thumb behind you.

64
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,300
The middle finger will support the index finger in front of you.

65
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:47,800
And the pinky finger will support the thumb.

66
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,200
I know at this point, you all must be like,

67
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,500
what is this?

68
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,500
This must be freaking you out.

69
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:57,800
And I used to feel the same when I used to see my mom dress up.

70
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:02,400
But, I mean, once you do it, believe me, it's not that complex.

71
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,300
Now, it's time to make the first pleat.

72
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:10,600
So, to make the first pleat, you will place your fingers like this.

73
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:16,300
And then, you will place it in front of your belly button like this.

74
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,000
Why?

75
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,200
Because here, you will check that when you are placing the first pleat in front of your belly button,

76
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,000
whether it is a straight line or not.

77
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,500
If it is not, then add a little fabric in it.

78
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:33,700
And keep doing it until there is a straight line in front of you.

79
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:40,600
Once your straight line is formed, this is the point where the first pleat will be yours.

80
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,500
So, once you have that point in front of you,

81
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:48,400
hold it with your index finger and middle finger in front of you,

82
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,300
adjust it with your thumb.

83
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:53,800
On the right side, you will feel that there is a lot of extra fabric left.

84
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,800
Don't worry, no one is going to see it.

85
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,800
First, you have to make the pleats perfect.

86
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:05,700
And after that, you will make the second pleat by rotating your fingers in the same way.

87
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:08,200
Here, there is another important point.

88
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:13,300
To make the second pleat a little smaller than the first pleat,

89
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:18,400
it cleanses the pleats and pleats look better.

90
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,100
Once you have made the second pleat, you do it like this.

91
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:26,500
Third, fourth, fifth, you will make all the pleats of the same size as the second.

92
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,900
The first should be bigger than the second, third, fourth, fifth.

93
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,900
All the pleats will be of the same size and length.

94
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,900
The first will be a little bigger.

95
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:42,300
Once your pleats are made, gather them all and clean up each pleat.

96
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:45,900
At this point, you can also apply some pins on the pleats.

97
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:49,700
Just in case, if any pleat is opened, then it is not like that.

98
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,300
Once the pleats are opened, you can do it.

99
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,300
I am so used to skipping this point.

100
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:59,300
And then, looking at the length from the bottom,

101
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:03,300
according to the height, you have to tuck the pleats inside.

102
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:07,300
Now, on the right side, there is a little bit of fabric left.

103
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,300
Don't worry about this.

104
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,300
Tuck it in cleanly.

105
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:13,300
It will hide under the pleats.

106
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,300
I don't want to show this area.

107
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,300
Tuck it in.

108
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:21,300
Clean up the left side that you want to show.

109
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:24,300
You have to make this part a little tighter,

110
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,300
so that the shape of the body is enhanced.

111
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:29,300
You know that shape, the curve from the waist to the hips.

112
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:32,300
This is the point where we enhance that curve.

113
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,300
Tighten it a little.

114
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:39,300
Push the extra fabric under the pleats.

115
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,300
And then, with the safety pin,

116
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:45,300
pin the extra fabric along with the pleats.

117
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,300
Now, the last and final step.

118
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,300
That is adjusting the pleats.

119
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:55,300
Pin it properly to the length you had decided to pin there.

120
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:59,300
And keep in mind that pinning from the back of the shoulder

121
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:02,300
gives a little cleaner look.

122
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:05,300
If you are reaching with your hand, then do it yourself.

123
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:09,300
Call your mom, sister, brother, husband, whatever is available,

124
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:13,300
pin it from the back and you are done.

125
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:16,300
Now, because this sari is lightweight,

126
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:21,300
making the pleats was a little easy and you didn't have to adjust anything.

127
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,300
But, if you are wearing a silk sari,

128
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:26,300
then this step is not that easy.

129
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:30,300
So, what I did is that I also draped a silk sari

130
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,300
just to make it easier for you all.

131
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:35,300
So, largely everything is the same.

132
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,300
Just two steps are different.

133
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,300
First of all, when you are making pleats,

134
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:42,300
then there are chances that the pleats don't look clean.

135
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:45,300
Everything will look fine from the top, but the bottom will be messed up.

136
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:50,300
So, what you can do is call for help, husband, brother, mom,

137
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:53,300
whatever is available at home, call them.

138
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:56,300
Like I called Mr. Husband here.

139
00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:00,300
And I asked him to sit there and from the bottom,

140
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,300
ask them to get us the plate.

141
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,300
The line that is coming from the top,

142
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,300
while following it,

143
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:09,300
align the pleats with each other.

144
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,300
And once this step is done,

145
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:15,300
then you can run a little warm iron on your pleats.

146
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:18,300
And the pleats will be completely set.

147
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,300
Another thing that I like to do with the heavy sari,

148
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,300
which is a little heavy,

149
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:27,300
is that I gently tuck the pleats in

150
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,300
from the safety pin so that they get a clean look.

151
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:34,300
So, what I do for this is that the bottom part of the pleats

152
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,300
that is coming from the front,

153
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,300
I neatly pleat it like this.

154
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:42,300
And on the left side, I pin it towards the top.

155
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,300
What happens with this is that,

156
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,300
while eating or talking,

157
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:49,300
if the left hand gets a little lower,

158
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,300
then it won't be like the whole pleat is open

159
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,300
and falling on the ground.

160
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:56,300
It looks a little clean and all over,

161
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:59,300
it becomes easy to handle the pleats for you.

162
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:02,300
So, this is how I drape a sari.

163
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,300
A lot of you guys wanted to see it.

164
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,300
So, here is the tutorial for it.

165
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:09,300
I hope you got some tips and tricks.

166
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,300
And by following this video,

167
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,300
you can easily drape the sari.

168
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:16,300
